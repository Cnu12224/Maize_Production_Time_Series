# 🌾 Maize Production Time Series Forecasting

This project performs time series analysis and forecasting on maize crop production data. It aims to identify trends, seasonality, and make future predictions using statistical models such as ARIMA.

## 🔍 Features

- Time series cleaning and transformation
- Trend and seasonality decomposition
- Stationarity testing and differencing
- Forecasting using ARIMA and SARIMA
- Visualization of historical and predicted values

## 📚 Dataset

- Historical maize production data (could be from FAO, local agri databases, etc.)

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Statsmodels
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Cnu12224/Maize_Production_Time_Series.git
   cd Maize_Production_Time_Series
